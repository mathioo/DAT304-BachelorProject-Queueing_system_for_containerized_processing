\chapter{Conclusion}




When we started, the intention was to create a full proof of concept implementation of the system that should be easy to use, improve, scale, and maintain over time. But due to time constraints, as Kubernetes alone took most of our time to understand and lack of development experience between the group members, we did not manage to fulfill this. However we still believe this is a promising avenue of approach. We hope that even if we did not manage to implement a working proof of concept, we have shown through the theory and models that there is a good foundation to build upon and implement if someone with more development experience are to attempt the implementation. As we have shown through the future works section, there still is a fair amount of research, testing and work to be done before the product is fully ready for a production environment.\\\\

This project has been a challenge for the entire group. In hindsight, it might have been a bit too ambitious. However, from a personal perspective we feel it was a success, as we managed to lay the groundwork for further work. We also got experience with multiple new technologies as well as pushed our limits when it comes to software development, and as such we have grown our basis for decision making in future projects.
